This project is for my automated cat litter box/house.  A nodemcu V3 is automating motion lights in the litter box, which is the lower area. There's an upper level with the water/food bowl which I have a dispenser for both.  A 3-D printed container for both, the food container has a stepper motor rotating a disc with a window to drop food down to the bowl.  The water container has a solenoid actuated valve to release the water.  There are two strips of WS2811 addressable LED's facing down from the ceiling.  I am using MQTT with a mosquitto broker and Raspberry Pi with Node-red for a UI for my whole house automation.  Future plans include pan/tilt laser pointer setup mounted to the top corner of the cat house. Also, strain gauges under the food/water bowl to measure the weight of both and report back when the bowls are getting low. Or not, so I don't add to the bowl if not depleated to prevent overflow!
